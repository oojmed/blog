Hello! As you may have noticed, we've updated our blog quite a bit.

We've:
 - [Started posting TxtToSL Server changelogs](/txttosl-server/2019-12-14_1/)
 - [Open sourced our blog even more, with our entire setup (posts, icons, and more)](https://github.com/oojmed/hikari-company)
 - [And made a lot of UI updates to Hikari Company (our Jekyll theme, which we use in our blog)](https://github.com/oojmed/hikari-company)

We've been focusing on improving our UI for the past week or so, so look out for more big UI changes soon.
