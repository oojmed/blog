### Prelude
This is a very simplified, short, mostly estimated 'timeline', please do your own research before taking any of this into account.


### The Timeline
(Again, this is super short and simple, plus guessed / estimated.)

Meaning over time (estimated by us, chronological order):

| Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------- |
| Excitable, happy | In a queer mood |
| Different, abnormal, strange | He's being weird and queer. |
| A slur / insult for LGBTQ+ people | Eww, queer. |
| Taken back, as a way to say LGBTQ+ easily &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | I'm queer! |

Thanks for reading!
