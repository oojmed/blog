As you may have noticed, we just released our new home(page) redesign!

[You can find it at our main site](https://oojmed.com).

It's now much simpler, with only one page and no stretched useless images, and now contains all of our projects, plus some more things like an introduction and FAQ.

We also updated our blog a bit, making the home / main page color scheme a lot less vibrant and harsh, instead using dark shades of gray.

Also also, we have a new project related to [TxtToSL](https://txttosl.com) that we're going to release publicly soonâ„¢, so look out for it.
