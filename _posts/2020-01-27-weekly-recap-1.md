Hello everyone!

We're starting a new 'Weekly Recap' series, which we aim to help us be:
1. More transparent and
2. More active

<br>

So for last week:
- Released and introduced [Formuliser](https://oojmed.com/formuliser/) in the middle of the week (and [updated it several times throughout](https://github.com/oojmed/formuliser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)) - It's also of course [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/oojmed/formuliser)
- Two days ago we had a [some small maintenance on our servers](https://status.oojmed.com/history) (that only lasted ~10 minutes)
- We're now (today!) releasing the public beta of our TxtToSL Discord Bot! [You can find the invite for the bot here](https://invite.txttosl.com).
