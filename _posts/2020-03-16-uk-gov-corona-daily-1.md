This is in chronological order, and is simplified and summarised. For more information watch the full event.

 - Avoid non-essential travel, both foreign and local (pubs, clubs, etc)
 - Minimal social and physical contact
 - Work at home if you can
 - Shielding the vulnerable with serious underlying medical conditions for 12 weeks
 - Avoid mass gatherings
 - From tomorrow no longer supporting mass gatherings with emergency workers
 - UK entering fast growth period
 - Whole household isolation: one person in a household gets a fever or cough the whole household have to stay isolated for 14 days
 - Recommending social distancing again
 - Repeating to avoid gathering and travel
 - Mostly repeating
 - Other measures may be necessary 'like school closures' but they need to happen at the right time
 - They mostly only care about death rates not number of cases
 - Direct death: just cause disease
 - Indirect death: from no medical care - main aim
 - 'Older people above 70, people in adult life who would normally be advised to have a flu vaccine (chronic diseases), pregnant women' - who they care about
 - Even smaller list of people incoming
 - People with cancer / immune system suppressing diseases etc
 - Reiterating whole household isolation
 - You will probably get it if you live in a household with someone with it
 - Again, don't contact NHS if you are self isolating with just mild or moderate disease, they basically don't care
 - But if anyone's health is getting worse do contact
 - Daily updates
 - As much transparency as possible
