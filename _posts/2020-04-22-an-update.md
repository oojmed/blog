We are starting our investigation once again after stopping. We stopped as the account we were using for interviewing on Discord has been banned. It is still unknown to us why exactly, as not many people are actually banned for just being in these anti-LGBT servers, so it seems we may have been targetted and falsely reported for hate speech due to people knowing we were journalists. This is just a theory however, it could have been a legitmate ban and report.

From today we are starting again and hoping to get even more interviews out in the coming weeks.

Thank you all for your patience.
